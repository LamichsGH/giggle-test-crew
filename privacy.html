Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified. Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online identifiers.</p>

	<h3>4.	What Are My Rights?</h3>
<p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights, which we will always work to uphold:</p>
	<li>a)	The right to be informed about our collection and use of your personal data. This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but you can always contact us to find out more or to ask any questions using the details in Part 10.
	<li>b)	The right to access the personal data we hold about you. Part 9 will tell you how to do this.

	<li>f)	The right to object to us using your personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.
	<li>g)	The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we am using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.
	<li>h)	Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling. we do not use your personal data in this way.

	<h3>5.	What Personal Data Do You Collect?</h3>
<p>Subject to the following, we do not collect any personal data from you. we do not place cookies on your computer or device, nor do we use any other means of data collection.
If you send us an email, we may collect your name, your email address, and any other information which you choose to give us.</p>

	<h3>6.	How Do You Use My Personal Data?</h3>
<p>If we do collect any personal data through registration, it will be processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected. we will comply with our obligations and safeguard your rights under the GDPR at all times. For more details on security see Part 7, below.
As stated above, we do not generally collect any personal data. If you contact us and we obtain your personal details from your email, we may use them to respond to your email.

We will not share any of your data with any third parties for any purposes [other than storage on an email server.</p>

	<h3>7.	How and Where Do You Store My Data?</h3>
<p>We may store some or all of your personal data in countries that are not part of the European Economic Area (the “EEA” consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). These are known as “third countries” and may not have data protection laws that are as strong as those in the UK and/or the EEA. This means that we will take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR as follows.
Where we transfer your data to a third party based in the US, this may be protected if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield. This requires that third party to provide data protection to standards similar to those in Europe. More information is available from the European Commission.
Please contact us using the details below in Part 10 for further information about the particular data protection mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data to a third country.
Personal data security is essential to us, and to protect personal data, we take the following measures:
	•	We only hold your email address and work post iced which are stored on the Mailchimp server. This information is not stored anywhere else either physically or virtually.</p>

	<h3>8.	Do You Share My Personal Data?</h3>
<p>We contract with the following third  party for data storage purposes of registrants of our service; Mailchimp
	•	Mailchimp Inc, Located at; Ponce City Market, Atlanta, Georgia</p>

<p>If any of your personal data is transferred to a third party, as described above, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data is handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, our obligations, and the third party’s obligations under the law, as described above in Part 7.
If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will take suitable steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR, as explained above in Part 7.
In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>

	<h3>9.	How Can I Access My Personal Data?</h3>
<p>If you want to know what personal data we have about you, you can ask us for details of that personal data and for a copy of it (where any such personal data is held). This is known as a “subject access request”.
All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses shown in Part 10. To make this as easy as possible for you, a Subject Access Request Form is available for you to use. You do not have to use this form, but it is the easiest way to tell us everything we need to know to respond to your request as quickly as possible.
There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to cover our administrative costs in responding.
We will respond to your subject access request within one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive your request. You will be kept fully informed of we progress.</p>

	<h3>10.	How Do I Contact You?</h3>
<p>To contact us about anything to do with your personal data and data protection, including to make a subject access request, please use the following details:

Any changes will be immediately posted on our Site and you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Privacy Policy on your first use of our Site following the alterations. we recommend that you check this page regularly to keep up-to-date.</p>
